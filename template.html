<p>Doe, John is a normal student. He goes to a great school, procrastinates on his personal project drafts and complains about how much work he has; just like everyone else. John is male, 5’9&nbsp;and he’s not super special in any other way, he’s average. The purposes of this description are not to belittle John for not being special, but to show that John is a normal person.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Description of John</h2>

<p>John is a hard-worker, almost to a fault. He stays up late on the nights before his tests;&nbsp;he makes meticulous notes on all of his subjects and learns from them as best he can. He puts in 100% of the effort. But, John does <strong>not</strong> get the grades he wants. Even with the amount of hard work he puts in, he still has to deal with the 4s and 5s he gets on his reports. Meanwhile, he looks around and sees people put in half the effort and still get 6s and 7s, <em>with ease.&nbsp;</em>There’s this one girl he notices, Samantha. She shares quite a few classes with John: Math, Physics and Business, but they never seem to talk.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Details and the canyon</h3>

<p>Over time, he forms divisions in his mind, as does everyone around him. To rationalize why he works hard and gets 5s and why Samantha works only a little and gets 7s, he divides people into normal and smart.<em>Oh of course, she’s just smart (and you’re not), says his inner voice.</em> As the grades pile up over the years, these divisions get reinforced, and he accepts this social dogma. <em>Of course, some people are just born smart,&nbsp;that’s why they do well at school.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>A river flowing over time carved the Grand Canyon, and so too does this thought flowing through John’s mind. It carves a division between him and Samantha; A division of intelligence.&nbsp;<sup><a id="ffn1" href="#fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Soon, a business test approaches. He studies before it, meticulously. He makes 15 pages of notes and stays up late, revising them. <em><strong>Come test time, he cannot seem to recall what was on his notes</strong></em>. He looks over at Samantha, writing rapidly but not anxiously. Fast forward to getting the test back, he knows he didn’t do as well as he wanted, he’s nervous, but looks over at Samantha sitting there, unconcerned.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 5 he gets disappoints him, <em>again</em>. For the amount of effort he put in, he should have got a 7, a 6 at least. With a sigh of resignation, he asks Samantha, “What did you get?”</p>

<p>She replies that she got a 7, without the slightest hint of conceit.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Well, of course she got a 7, she’s smart,</em> says his inner voice</p>

<p>He continues, “That’s great! You’re just so <em>smart</em>.”</p>

<p>“Not really,” she says. “I just have a great system.”</p>

<p>John continues, intrigued, “What do you mean a system, don’t you just make notes?”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Nope, I’ve tried notes and they don’t work for me, at least not for Business.”</p>

<p>“Well, how do you study then?”</p>

<p>“I use a different study method, flashcards”</p>

<p>In that moment, John has an epiphany, he’s never tried anything other than making his notes. Maybe Samantha is not just smart, maybe she just has a better <strong>system</strong> of studying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Could you show me?” he asks, sheepishly.</p>

<p>“Of course,&quot; she responds, sliding her laptop towards him.</p>

<p>He sees her “system”, <em>Anki</em>. He realizes something in that moment which people fail to realize all their life, <strong>maybe he is wrong</strong>. Maybe, <strong>it is <em>how</em> Samantha studies</strong> that helps her get good grades. It’s not pure IQ. He realizes something incredibly important, the fault, lay not with him or with his effort, but with the way he studied.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let me repeat that for your benefit, reader, <strong>the fault, lay not with him or with his effort, but with the way he studied.</strong> John, our protagonist is not stupid, nor is he an extreme genius, he was just <em>stubborn</em> in his ways and subconsciously refused to change. His belief that some people were smart was the very thing keeping him from changing and trying new things. His belief in Samantha’s <em>intelligence</em> was preventing him from achieving his goals. This belief led him into the vicious cycle of trying harder, not achieving and blaming his intelligence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is John’s parable&nbsp;and parables have morals. The moral of this parable, is that we all carry John in our minds to some extent. If you believe that some people do better than you because of their intelligence, you are being John in that moment. That is why, I urge you to cast away that thought from your mind and seriously give <em>yourself</em> some thought. Attack, with as much criticism as you can, <em>your system</em>. Not you as a person, but your system of studying. Question yourself, as John did: Have you ever tried novel ways of studying? The last time you got a poor grade and your friend got a good one, is it really because they are smarter or they just had a better way of studying?</p>

<p>John could have had this epiphany way earlier, if only he had gotten over his meekness and asked Samantha earlier. So ask the Samanthas in your life, ask the people who seem to get good grades how they do that, and if they say they’re just smart, probe deeper, because <em>intelligence is never the only reason behind success.</em></p>
